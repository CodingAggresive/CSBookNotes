Microsoft maintains both runtimes for building applications with .NET, and they share many of the same APIs. This shared API is what is called the .NETStandard.

Developers use the .NET framework to create Windows desktop applications and server based applications. This includes ASP.NET web applications. .NETÂ Core is used to create server applications that run on Windows, Linux and Mac. It does not currently support creating desktop applications with a user interface. Developers can write applications and libraries in VB.NET, C# and F# in both runtimes.
